# Weather Checker REST API üå¶Ô∏è

The Weather Checker is a ****RESTful API**** built using ****Node.js and Express****, providing real-time weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API. This project demonstrates the seamless integration of external APIs into a Node.js backend, allowing clients, including React applications, to retrieve weather information effortlessly.

## Key Features üöÄ

- [x] **Real-Time Weather Data**: Provides up-to-date weather information fetched from the OpenWeatherMap API.
- [x]  **RESTful Architecture**: Follows RESTful principles for API design, ensuring scalability and ease of use.
- [x]  **Node.js and Express**: Utilizes Node.js and Express for building a robust and efficient server-side application.
- [x] **Public API Integration**: Demonstrates the ability to manipulate and present data retrieved from external APIs.
- [x] **Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)**: Enables secure communication between the API server and client-side applications, including React.
